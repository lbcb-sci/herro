| :exclamation:  HERRO is available in Dorado   |
|-----------------------------------------|
If you would like to use HERRO models for error correction, they are currently available as part of the [Dorado basecaller](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado?tab=readme-ov-file#read-error-correction).

# HERRO

HERRO (Haplotype-aware ERRor cOrrection)  is a highly accurate, haplotype-aware, deep-learning tool for error correction of Nanopore R10.4.1, Kit 14 reads (length of â‰¥ 10000bp is recommended). An experimental model for R9.4.1 data is also provided for download.

## Requirements

- Linux OS (tested on RHEL 8.6 and Ubuntu 22.04)
- [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/)
- Python (and conda) for data preprocessing

### Compile from source

- [libtorch 2.0.*](https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu117/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.1%2Bcu117.zip)
- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)


## Installation

0. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dominikstanojevic/herro.git
cd herro
```

1. Create conda environment
```shell
conda env create --file scripts/herro-env.yml
```

2. Build ```herro``` binary (singularity or compile from source)

    a. Download singularity image:
    
    1. Download the image
    ```shell
    wget -O herro.sif https://zenodo.org/records/13802680/files/herro.sif?download=1
    ```
    

    b. Build singularity image (requires sudo)
    ```shell
    sudo singularity build herro.sif herro-singularity.def
    ```
    
    Run the tool (see [Usage](#usage)) with: ```singularity run --nv --bind <host_path>:<dest_path> herro.sif inference <args>```

    c. Compile
    
    When compiling from source, ensure that libtorch and rustup are downloaded and installed.

    ```shell
    export LIBTORCH=<libtorch_path>
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBTORCH/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=native" cargo build -q --release
    ```
    Path to the resulting binary: ```target/release/herro```

   Building the Singularity image or compiling from source takes just a few minutes on a standard machine.

## Model Download

  1. Download model:
     
  For R10.4.1 data,
  ```shell
  wget -O model_R10_v0.1.pt https://zenodo.org/records/12683277/files/model_v0.1.pt?download=1
  ```
  For R9.4.1 data (experimental),
  ```shell
  wget -O model_R9_v0.1.pt https://zenodo.org/records/12683277/files/model_R9_v0.1.pt?download=1
  ```

Models can also be found on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/12683277](https://zenodo.org/records/12683277)

## Usage

1. Preprocess reads
```shell
scripts/preprocess.sh <input_fastq> <output_prefix> <number_of_threads> <parts_to_split_job_into>
```
Note: Porechop loads all reads into memory, so the input may need to be split into multiple parts. Set <parts_to_split_job_into> to 1 if splitting is not needed. In Dorado v0.5, adapter trimming was added, so adapter trimming and splitting using Porechop and duplex tools will probably be removed in the future.

2. minimap2 alignment and batching

Although minimap2 can be run from the ```herro``` binary (omit --read-alns or use --write-alns to store batched alignments for future use), the preferred method is to initially run minimap2 and then utilize it to generate alignment batches. These batches will be used as input for the ```herro``` binary.

```shell
scripts/create_batched_alignments.sh <output_from_reads_preprocessing> <read_ids> <num_of_threads> <directory_for_batches_of_alignments> 
```
Note: Read ids can be obtained with seqkit: ```seqkit seq -ni <reads> > <read_ids>```

3. Error-correction
```shell
herro inference --read-alns <directory_alignment_batches> -t <feat_gen_threads_per_device> -d <gpus> -m <model_path> -b <batch_size> <preprocessed_reads> <fasta_output> 
```
Note: GPUs are specified using their IDs. For example, if the value of the parameter -d is set to 0,1,3, herro will use the first, second, and fourth GPU cards. Parameter ```-t``` is given **per device** - e.g., if ```-t``` is set to ```8``` and 3 GPUs are used, herro will create 24 feature generation theads in total. Recommended batch size is 64 for GPUs with 40 GB (possibly also for 32 GB) of VRAM and 128 for GPUs with 80 GB of VRAM.

## Results on HG002 data

HG002 data was assembled using hifiasm and compared to HiFi reads. Results for uncorrected reads are not given since they produce poor assembly. Currently, data is not publicly available.

Assembly results and comparison with Hifi reads and uncorrected UL are given in the table below. Assemblies were perform using:

1. Hifi reads/Duplex ONT reads/Corrected UL reads
2. Uncorrected Ultra-long ONT reads as UL reads
3. Parental Illumina data

Hifiasm command used for all experiments:
```shell
hifiasm -o <output_prefix> -t <num_threads> --ul <UL_reads> --ul-cut 10000 -1 <parent1_yak> -2 <parent2_yak> <HiFi/Duplex/Corrected UL reads>
```
